# ruleOfThree
This application is created to help users find faster answers for the math problems they encounter.

This application has two parts. The rule of three and the double rule of three.
The Rule of Three Usage Example:
If a spaceship travels 177 a.u. in 419 days, in how many days will travel 211 a.u.?
On the first column we enter values 177 on top and 211 on bottom; on the second column we enter the value 419 and when we press the button calculate the answer 499.4859 (days) will be displayed.
The Double Rule of Three Usage Example:
If 177 engineers build one spaceship in 419 days, in how many days will finish the same project 211 engineers?
On the first column we have 177 and 211 (number of engineers), on the second column we have 1 and 1 (number of spaceships) and on the third column we have the value 419(days). When we press the button calculate the answer 351.4834 (days) will be displayed.
